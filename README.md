# Development Status

Stable and maintained. Under development as needs arise.

## Description

This library offers you a series of macros supported by a C-based implementation to introduce timed traces inside your code. They may be used to debug your program and its threads and overwise measure the performance of groups of operations.

The library also reports its results into a JSON format compatible with the tracing user interface found in Google Chrome. These reports may be loaded inside chrome by going to chrome://tracing, which opens a dedicated interface for trace viewing.

The implementation is inspired by chrome's tracing capabilities yet was entirely written independently.

See:
    https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool

## Usage

Include the `src/spdr_*_unit.c` file for your platform to your build.

Import [spdr.h](./include/spdr/spdr.h). Hopefully it is small and easy
enough to understand.

You will initialize the library first, with your own memory buffer,
enable the tracing to happen, then dump the results to disk in order
to import them in chrome:tracing.

```C
        /* at program init */
        assert(spdr_init(&spdr, spdr_buffer, spdr_buffer_size) == 0,
            "could not initialize SPDR");
        /* ... */
        /* start a new recording */
        spdr_enable_trace(spdr, TRACING_ENABLED);
        /* ... */

        /* stop recording and record result to disk */
        FILE* file = fopen("trace.json", "rb");
        spdr_report(spdr, SPDR_CHROME_REPORT, print, file);
        fclose(file);
        spdr_reset(spdr);
        /* ... */
        /* at program exit */
        spdr_deinit(&spdr);
```

Check examples/ for some typical uses.

### Tracing

```C
    SPDR_BEGIN1(spdr, "Main", "printf", SPDR_STR("format", "Hello, world."));
    printf("Hello, world\n");
    SPDR_END(spdr, "Main", "printf");
```

With:

```C
    SPDR_BEGIN1(context, category, trace_name, argument);
    SPDR_END(context, category, trace_name);
```

This will trace the printf call and associate a textual argument to
it.

Argument keys, categories and names are meant to be litteral or last for the duration of your instrument program, so as to limit their number. Traces where these values would grow with time would become hard to read and understand. Any time varying data should be kept in argument values (such as the "Hello, world." string above)

The library will also keep direct pointers to them for performance reasons, so make sure these strings are valid for the entire use of the library.

The string arguments however are copied so you may deallocate them. This is were your time-varying data should be stored.

### Reporting

Reporting may be done as the application is running or with less
overhead at the end of a tracing period, using the reporting
function. You are expected to provide I/O functions to allow the
library to write into a file/console or even produce a network stream.

For instance the following example will produce a report into
traces.json that can then be directly loaded in Chrome's tracing
console.

```C
static void report(const char* line, void* user_data)
{
    FILE* file = user_data;

    fputs(line, file);
}

static void foo()
{
    /* ... */

    FILE* f = fopen("traces.json", "wb");
    if (f) {
        spdr_report(gbl_spdr, SPDR_CHROME_REPORT, report, f);
        fclose(f);
    }
```

### Compilation

This implementation is mostly comformant to ANSI C90, with common extensions,
like the Long Long integer modifier.

It also makes use of C99's integer types. It does not use external dependencies
besides a system's headers. This should let you compile on most platforms.

Tested platforms as of 2017-08:

*     Linux, GCC
*     MacOSX, GCC and Clang
*     Windows, Visual Studio 2015
*     Windows, Visual Studio 2017

You only need to compile one source file to add SPDR into your app,
then simply import the headers found in include/ to use it.

Depending on your platform:
*     src/spdr_linux_unit.c  (you need -lrt to link)
*     src/spdr_osx_unit.c
*     src/spdr_win32_unit.c
*     src/spdr_win64_unit.c

Use of the library in C++ is supported, you must include the
include/spdr/spdr.hh header rather than spdr.h.

## Implementation & Design

### Allocation

During tracing, the library does not do any allocation of its own, and
uses a simple linear allocator. This allows you to control precisely
how much memory is reserved for the tracing of events and reduces
overhead.

Arguments and traces are allocated on this pre-allocated memory arena.

During reporting, some dynamic allocations may be performed.

### Threads

Use from multiple thread is supported and expected. Lock-free atomic
operations are used thanks to Hans Boehm's atomic_ops library.

Traces are stored by linear allocation into a set of buckets so that
concurrent accesses are as independant as possible. The number of
buckets used is set at compile-time, and defaults to 8.

### Clocks

Tracing requires a monotonic clock with microsecond precision.

*     QueryPerformanceCounter is used for windows.
*     CLOCK_MONOTONIC is used for Posix platforms, such as Linux.
*     The native mach clock is used for MacOSX.

You may specify your own clock/timer function to return the current
elapsed microseconds, overriding the default internal one.

See:
```C
void spdr_set_clock_microseconds_fn(struct SPDR_Context *context,
             unsigned long long (*clock_microseconds_fn)(void* user_data),
             void *user_data);
```
