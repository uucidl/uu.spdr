0.4.3 -- SPDR now supports Visual Studio 2017
         
         The reason this is the thing, is that an optimizer 
         code generation defect popped up, that we had to workaround.
         
0.4.2 -- SPDR learned how to emit Async event pairs:
             SPDR_ASYNC_EVENT_BEGIN / SPDR_ASYNC_EVENT_END

         An async event takes an identifier which allows the trace viewer to pair
         the end and the beginning even if they come from different threads.

      -- We allow building SPDR as a C++ program with Visual Studio and Clang.
      -- The library is more hygienic with the symbols it exports
      -- SPDR learned to accept a null SPDR_Context as indicating that no
         tracing is to be done.

0.4.1 -- compiling on windows without warnings
0.4.0 -- project layout changed to simplify compilation:
  - one _unit.c file per platform,
  - fixed some warnings on MSVC.
0.3.1 -- the library now logs more events for the same buffer size.
0.3.0 -- move header files to their own subdirectory
0.2.2 -- handle NaN and Inf properly for latest chrome/trace event viewer
0.2.1 -- compilation fix for mingw32-gcc
0.2.0 -- changing code conventions
         moving to better code conventions, this however requires a minor
         API change (spdr_context becomes SPDR_Context)

0.1.1 -- bugfix for posix clock becoming incorrect when seconds boundaries
         were crossed. [questor <questor@unseen-academy.de>]

0.1.0 -- initial release
